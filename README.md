# Mechanical Ink Open Source Maintainer Fund

The Mechanical Ink Open Source Maintainer Fund is a dedicated initiative aimed at providing financial support to open-source maintainers and projects. As part of our commitment to the open source community, Mechanical Ink pledges to contribute 1% of all our company's earnings to this fund on a monthly basis.

The fund's primary objective is to identify and assist maintainers and projects that play a crucial role in the wider open source, business, and tech ecosystem, ensuring their sustainability and continued contributions. We aim to raise sufficient funds to launch impactful initiatives that directly benefit the maintainers and projects needing support.

Mechanical Ink, a recognized and trusted entity in the industry, is proud to spearhead this effort. We believe in the importance of open source and its positive impact on innovation and collaboration. By driving the Mechanical Ink Open Source Maintainer Fund, we aim to foster a thriving open-source community that is resilient, inclusive, and sustainable.

We invite you to join us in this endeavor as we work together to empower the maintainers and projects that fuel the open-source ecosystem. Together, we can make a meaningful difference and ensure the long-term success of the open-source ecosystem. More importantly, we can ensure those working in the open-source space can thrive and not merely survive.

> **Note:** It is still early days (June 15, 2023), so please stay tuned for news as we grow the fund.
